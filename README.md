# Gibbed Mod Hook for DXHRDC*.
*\* Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut, because the title is stupid long.*

Modernized version of my original ModHook for DXHRDC, released circa 2013.

This adds functionality to the game so that all `*.000` files in the `mods` subdirectory in the game directory are loaded, so we don't have to touch the original archives at all.

## Compatibility

* 2.0.0.0, Steam, original release
* 2.0.0.0, Steam, patch #1
* 2.0.0.0, GOG
